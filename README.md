## Overview

Models is a Swift package designed to provide lightweight, reusable protocols for common data
models.  It simplifies everyday coding tasks by offering integrated abstractions for these models.

This package focuses on providing practical protocols that:

- Formalize patterns found in common data models.
- Enhance reusability and readability of data-related code in Swift projects.

By integrating Models into your project, you can reduce boilerplate code, improve readability and
maintainability, and adopt standardized patterns for data models in modern Swift apps and packages.

## Features

Models provides reusable protocols and strongly typed data structures for common domains.  It
enhances type safety, standardizes data representation, and promotes consistency across Swift-based
projects.

### Events

Encapsulate scheduling and tracking concepts to support time-based activities and event management.

- Protocols
  - `Schedulable`
  - `Trackable`

### Geography

Define structured representations of geographic and administrative regions to standardize
location-based data.

- Enums
  - `AdministrativeZone`
  - `Country`
- Protocols
  - `Locatable`

### Metadata

Enable tracking record-level changes, ensuring data integrity and historical traceability.

- Protocols
  - `Trackable`

### People

Model individual and demographic characteristics to standardize identity-related data.

- Enums
  - `AgeBracket`
  - `Gender`
- Protocols
  - `Personable`

### UI

Ensure consistent representation of models across user interfaces using visual elements and system
imagery.

- Protocol
  - `SystemImageRepresentable`

## Installation
