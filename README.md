# Models

A Swift package that includes an integrated collection Swift protocols for common data model
patterns.

## Overview

Models is a Swift package designed to provide lightweight, reusable protocols for common data
models.  It simplifies everyday coding tasks by offering integrated abstractions for these models.

This package focuses on providing practical protocols that:

* Formalize patterns found in common data models.
* Enhance reusability and readability of data-related code in Swift projects.

By integrating Models into your project, you can reduce boilerplate code, improve readability and
maintainability, and adopt standardized patterns for data models in modern Swift apps and packages.

## Features

ðŸ›  **Custom Protocols**

Provide reusable, protocol-oriented abstractions for formalizing lightweight patterns found in
common data models.
